:star: We want to test that an alarm is raised, and also implement different alarm notification methods (For example: automatically call fire department, call owner's phone, and trigger control unit alarm siren). Plan and implement how you can extract the announcement logic and:
  1. Trigger many different announcement strategies
  2. Test that the different strategies was triggered

> Hint: Dependency Inversion Principle and the Strategy Design Pattern

> Take a look at the [Strategy design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern). This is a intermediate topic so ask if you're stuck.
