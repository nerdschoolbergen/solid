## Focus of this lesson

This lesson will focus on writing code that touches upon the various aspects of the SOLID principles.

## What you need

- IntelliJ Community Edition: [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- Java dev kit (Java 17 or later): [Java SE Development Kit](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/install/overview-jdk-installation.html)
- Alternative dev kit (Java 17 or later): [Eclipse Temurin Java Development Kit](https://adoptium.net/)

## Prerequisites

- Some previous experience with any object-oriented programming language is helpful

## How to get started

- Start by cloning this repository into a folder on your computer. If you've never used git before, you can alternatively use the the "Download ZIP" button to the right.
- Although you have this `README.md` file on your computer it's easier to read it on GitHub, so we recommend you keep this page open with the exercise tasks.

## Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises organized in markdown files. Each exercise builds on the previous.

- [Exercise 1 - Introduction](./exercise-1/README.md) (Start here)
- [Exercise 2 - Dependency Inversion Principle](./exercise-2/README.md)
- [Exercise 3 - Single Responsibility Principle](./exercise-3/README.md)
- [Exercise 4 - Interface Segregation Principle](./exercise-4/README.md)

Tip: The markdown files are best viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/nerdschoolbergen/solid) rather than on your computer.

Have fun! And remember to ask an instructor if you're stuck.

#### Icons with special meaning

- :pencil2: - A task you should do
- :book: - A section of text to read (no tasks, just information).
- :bulb: - Additional information.
- :exclamation: - Something important.
- :question: - Open-ended question for the reader ("What do you think would happen if...")
- :poop: - Bad practice (don't-do-this)
- :star: - A bonus task (not required)

#### Keyboard keys

Will look like this:

<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>

#### Diff blocks

Emphasizes how lines of text should change.

```diff
- this text was removed
