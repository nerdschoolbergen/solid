## Focus of this lesson

This lesson will focus on writing code that touches upon the various aspects of the SOLID principles.

## What you need

- IntelliJ Community Edition: [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- JDK Development Kit (JDK 17 or later): [Java SE Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- Alternative dev kit (Java 17 or later): [Eclipse Temurin Java Development Kit](https://adoptium.net/)

## Prerequisites

- Some previous experience with any object-oriented programming language is helpful

## How to get started

- Start by cloning this repository into a folder on your computer. If you've never used git before, you can alternatively use the the "Download ZIP" button to the right.
- Although you have this `README.md` file on your computer it's easier to read it on GitHub, so we recommend you keep this page open with the exercise tasks.

## Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises organized in markdown files. Each exercise builds on the previous.

- [Exercise 1 - Introduction](./exercise-1/README.md) (Start here)
- [Exercise 2 - Dependency Inversion Principle](./exercise-2/README.md)
- [Exercise 3 - Single Responsibility Principle](./exercise-3/README.md)
- [Exercise 4 - Interface Segregation Principle](./exercise-4/README.md)

Tip: The markdown files are best viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/nerdschoolbergen/solid) rather than on your computer.

Have fun! And remember to ask an instructor if you're stuck.
