## How to get started

- Start by cloning this repository into a folder on your computer. If you've never used git before, you can alternatively use the the "Download ZIP" button to the right.
- Although you have this `README.md` file on your computer it's easier to read it on GitHub, so we recommend you keep this page open with the exercise tasks.

## Exercises

This repository contains a set of exercises organized in markdown files. Each exercise builds on the previous.

- [Exercise 1 - Introduction](./exercise-1/README.md) (Start here)
- [Exercise 2](./exercise-2/README.md)
- [Exercise 3](./exercise-3/README.md)
- [Exercise 4 (bonus)](./exercise-5/README.md)
